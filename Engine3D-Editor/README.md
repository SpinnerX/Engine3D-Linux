# Engine3D Editor

## Overview
This is the UI editor for Engine3D. Where it is going to be considered as a seperate project, as I have some plans for using Engine3D \
for other things in the future. During the development of Engine3D, this will be used to test Engine3D in the form of a UI Editor. Showing \
different capabilities of what Engine3D can do.
